### Oi! :wave:

My name is Alexander and I'm a CS student from Sweden. In my spare time I work on Minecraft server mods, such as [PlotSquared](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/PlotSquared) and [Hyperverse](https://hyperver.se). I also like to play around with other Java projects. A project I am particularly proud of is [Incendo/cloud](https://commandframework.cloud), so you should really check that out :cow:

I am also the founder of IntellectualSites ([GitHub](https://github.com/IntellectualSites)/[Discord](https://discord.gg/KxkjDVg)) and Incendo ([GitHub](https://github.com/Incendo)/[Discord](https://discord.gg/aykZu32)). You can always reach me in the Incendo Discord! My personal Discord tag is (currently) Citymonstret#8560.
