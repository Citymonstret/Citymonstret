### Oi! :wave:

My name is Alexander, and I'm a software developer from Sweden. I currently work at @pafcloud, as a Senior Software Developer focusing on backend services using spring-boot.

In my spare time I work on Minecraft server mods, such as [PlotSquared](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/PlotSquared). I also like to play around with other Java projects. The project I'm the most proud of is [Incendo/cloud](https://commandframework.cloud), which is a command dispatcher for the JVM. The two programming languages I'm the most comfortable with are Java and Kotlin. As for spoken languages, I prefer English and Swedish - Although, I'm currently trying to learn Spanish as well (pero tengo que estudiar m√°s porque no lo hablo bien... :sweat_smile:)

I am also the founder of IntellectualSites ([GitHub](https://github.com/IntellectualSites)/[Discord](https://discord.gg/KxkjDVg)) and Incendo ([GitHub](https://github.com/Incendo)/[Discord](https://discord.gg/aykZu32)). You can always reach me in the Incendo Discord! My personal Discord tag is (currently) Citymonstret#8560.
